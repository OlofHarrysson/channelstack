#
Run experiment where we add a channel to the input image that is purely noise. The weights for that channel should approach zero.

#
Add some noise to e.g. the green channel and see if amplitude decreases. This is data augmentation and might increase val score.

#
Add more channel to see if it becomes better. Grey, blurry, edges

#
Find images how they look after first conv layer

#
Do backprop & guided backprop to see how much the channels contribute
